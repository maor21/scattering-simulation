# Scattering Simulation Package

## Purpose

This model is designed to visuallize an event of scattering by a given number of locallized particles.
Moreover, the intent is to give a broad picture on the differences between scattering of ordered and
disordered collections of particles. In particular the behaviour of crystalline-like and amorphous-like
arrangments.

## Scientific Background

this work aims to illustrate a simplyfied framework of the scattering of radiation by particles comprised
of glassy materials as compared to aerosol comprised of crystalline materials. it is important to assess 
the magnitude of the differences in radiative parameters/properties between particles comprised of amorphous
materials and particles comprised of crystalline materials, since these particles can be found in many physical
systems, and can influence many proccesses (e.g., aerosols and clouds are responsible for most of the uncertainty 
in radiative forcing in the atmosphere. amotphous particles can be found in both aerosols and clouds.)
To approach this, the internal morphology of each particle is modeled explicitly as a collection of
physical, nano-sized scattering centers arranged in either an amorphous arrangement or in a
crystalline arrangement. For now, this model focuses in two types of crystals: simple cubic, and face centered
cubic crystals.
