# Scattering Simulation Package

## Purpose

This model is designed to visuallize an event of scattering by a given number of locallized particles.
Moreover, the intent is to give a broad picture on the differences between scattering of ordered and
disordered collections of particles. In particular the behaviour of crystalline-like and amorphous-like
arrangments.
